To begin, we have :
  A report file that contains columns:
    Family
    Limber Pine (LP)
    Western White Pine (WWP)
    Sugar Pine (SP)
    Whitebark Pine (WBP)
    Genes
    Genomes
    PfamId/PfamCount
  A gene family file that contains columns:
    Accession
    Family Number
    Number of Genes
  A fasta file of each species (LP/WWP/SP/WBP)
  
The process:
  Create a fasta file with the family identifier (integer from report$Family)
  In genefamily, loop through each accession code (genefamily$accession) with that family number (genefamily$FamilyNumber)
    Read the first 2-3 chars, determine species code, then trim so true accession "c00000_g1_i1" remains
    Use species code and true accession number to find the relevant sequences
        Check if sequences are > 150 bp
    Store sequences in family fasta #include accession code? Not sure
    After all family files have been read, check to see if one of each family is included
        # May be able to do this ahead of this step for effeciency, but not sure how/if worth it
    If all four species are represented, move on to the next family!
        repeat ad nauseum (2024 times)
